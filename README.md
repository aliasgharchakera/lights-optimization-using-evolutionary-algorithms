# Optimization of Artificial Lights in a Room using Evolutionary Algorithms

## Introduction
This project is a part of the course **CS 451 Computation Intelligence** at **Habib University, Karachi**. The goal of this project is to optimize the position and number of artificial lights in a room using evolutionary algorithms. 

## Problem Statement
The problem statement is to optimize the position and number of artificial lights in a room such that the room is illuminated with the least number of lights and the least amount of energy is consumed.

## Solution
The solution to this problem is to use evolutionary algorithms to optimize the position and number of lights in a room. The room is represented as a 2D grid and the lights are represented as circles. The circles are placed randomly in the room and the fitness of each circle is calculated. The fitness of a circle is calculated by the number of cells in the room that are illuminated by the circle. The circles with the highest fitness are selected and the next generation of circles is created by applying crossover and mutation on the selected circles. The process is repeated until the room is illuminated with the least number of lights and the least amount of energy is consumed.

## Results
The results of the project are shared in the [report](Report/Optimizing_Illumination__Using_an_Evolutionary_Algorithm_to_Balance_Artificial_and_Natural_Light_in_Rooms.pdf) of the project.
